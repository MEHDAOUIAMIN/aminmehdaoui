    Presentation <BR>
    This much  <BR>-needed book on the design of algorithms and data structures for text processing emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical applications. It is intended to serve both as a textbook for courses on algorithm design, especially those related to text processing, and as a reference for computer science professionals. The work takes a unique approach, to other more general books one that goes more deeply into its topic than other more general books. It contains both classical algorithms and recent results of research on the subject. The book is the first text to contain a collection of a wide range of text algorithms, many of them quite new and appearing here for the first time. Other algorithms, while known by reputation, have never been published in the journal literature.
